## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-mcp.git
   cd weather-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (if using a weather API key):

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

   ```

### Usage

- You can change the default city or add more CLI options as needed.
